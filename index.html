                    <p>My name is Charity and I am an upcoming teacher. I am passionate about teaching and helping
                        students learn and grow. I
                        have a degree in Education and am currently studying for my masters in Educational Leadership. I
                        believe that every
                        child has the potential to learn and grow and I strive to create an environment in my classroom
                        that fosters creativity
                        and encourages critical thinking. I am excited to start my teaching career and look forward to
                        making a positive
                        difference in the lives of my students.

                        subjects, from English to Mathematics, and I am committed to providing an engaging, informative,
                        and supportive learning
                        environment for my students. I believe that learning should be fun, and I strive to make my
                        classes both enjoyable and
                        educational. I strive to provide a high-quality learning experience through creative activities
                        and thought-provoking
                        discussions. I understand that everyone has different learning styles, and I am committed to
                        tailoring my teaching
                        methods to the individual needs of my students.

                        believe in treating students with dignity and respect, and modeling appropriate behavior. My
                        physical interactions with
                        students are limited to handshakes, high-fives, and hugs (if requested by the student). I also
                        like to use body language
                        to show my enthusiasm and support. I often use hand gestures and facial expressions to emphasize
                        a point or to
                        illustrate a concept to help students better understand it.

                        They are organized and
                        always plan their tasks in advance. They are also very good at prioritizing their tasks and
                        staying focused on their
                        goals. They use a variety of tools to help them stay organized and on task, such as to-do lists,
                        calendars, and
                        productivity apps. They understand the importance of breaking larger tasks into smaller, more
                        manageable tasks and take
                        the time to properly plan and schedule their time.
